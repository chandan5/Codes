Codes
=====

codechef_extracter.py was used to extract codes from codechef.com

Prerequistes to use this script are:
   Module/Program: Command
1. BeautifulSoup4: sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
2. Requests: sudo pip install requests
3. w3m: sudo apt-get install w3m
   Python and Internet connection(obvio).

To use codechef_extracter.py to extract codes for any user clone the copy and paste the file in the folder where you want to store the codes then run the script it will prompt for username, enter the username and wohooo!! see the script downloading all your submitted practice problems(the last submitted code is downloaded for each solved problem).The speed of script depends on the speed of your internet connection.
I will improve the script in future.
